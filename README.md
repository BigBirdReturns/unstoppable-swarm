# 🛰️ Unstoppable v2 – Open Source AI Swarm Framework

This is the public scaffold for **Unstoppable v2** — a local-first, agent-coordinated, open-source AI orchestration system.

## 🧠 What It Is

A modular system designed to:
- Run adaptive AI agents in swarms
- Coordinate tasks with scoped memory and semantic drift control
- Use local vector-based memory instead of bloated prompt strings
- Enable trustless collaboration with decentralized coordination

## 📂 Current Structure

```

└── src/               # (scaffold coming next)
    ├── agents/
    ├── orchestrator/

    └── semantic/
```

## 🧪 Quick Start

Run the CLI:

```bash
python cli.py
```

You should see:

```
Unstoppable v2 CLI scaffold: Swarm orchestrator loading soon.
```

## 🚧 In Progress

- ✅ Repo live and scaffolded
- ✅ CLI works out of the box
- 🛠️ Agent class coming next
- 🛠️ Vector memory + persona overlay in queue
- 🛠️ Streamlit control panel to follow

## 🤝 Contribute

We're building this in public. If you're here to ship swarm code, create memory agents, or plug in a CRDT trust layer — fork it, clone it, or reach out.

No startup required. No cloud lock-in.  
Just sovereignty, structure, and swarm logic.
